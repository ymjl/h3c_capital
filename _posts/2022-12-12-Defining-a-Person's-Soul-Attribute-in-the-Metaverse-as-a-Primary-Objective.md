In the digital world, the internet extends the real world, and the asset world based on blockchain technology is a digital native asset system. Whether it is Fungible assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other ERC-20 tokens, or Non-Fungible  assets ERC-721, they all replicate and map assets in the real world. 

Therefore, Web3.0 technology based on blockchain offers the potential for the transformation of backend production relations in the metaverse. 

When we talk about web3.0 or metaverse, we often imagine that it will bring huge changes to human society, improve the efficiency of social operation, and maximize the release of user value. But how to build such a metaverse has not been clear. 

Here we propose a possibility: in the metaverse, defining a person's soul attribute will be the primary goal.


# Defining a Person's Soul Attributes in Metaverse as the Primary Goal
It is well known that web3.0 aims to address the imbalances in ecosystem development by emphasizing user ownership and balancing the relationship between platform, brand, and user. However, the definition of user identity remains an unresolved issue in web3.0.

The multi-chain ecosystem, such as Ethereum and BSC blockchain, as well as DID projects that solve identity issues, such as ENS, Cyberconnect, KNN3 Network, and RSS3, are all working together to construct the soul attribute of human beings in the metaverse and gradually complete the human face in the metaverse. Therefore, all activities in the metaverse require an anchor point: human beings.

The current development direction of web3.0 is primarily focused on DID (Decentralized Identity).

## The Application of Decentralized Identity (DID)
In general, DID applications can be divided into two categories: reputation and relationship.

### Reputation: Reputation/Resume/Social Display
In this application scenario, the focus is on simplifying the digital identity into some explicit and trustworthy tags to evaluate and classify users, thus achieving a quick screening effect. Here are three specific related examples: recruitment, unsecured lending, and stranger socializing.
#### Application cases
* Unsecured Lending:
 At present, it is difficult to completely rely on the chain identity for credit without breaking away from the real world. For example, the goldfinch, a chain credit protocol mainly aimed at real world enterprises, is unable to solve the personal credit problem.

 The protocol has an average daily income of $100,000 and an active loan amount of nearly $1 billion, enough to see the huge potential of the chain credit market.

* Recruitment:
Generate a chain resume to remove information discrepancies and quickly prove your ability to Web3.0 companies.
* Achievement:
The best example is POAP, the "attendance proof protocol", where the project side can issue ERC-1155 and non-transferable NFT achievements based on participants, and users can record their own chain activities.

### Relationship
In this kind of application scenarios, we focus on taking digital identity as the accumulation of user data in the Web3 environment, and use it for more complex and comprehensive application analysis. 
Application cases

* DAO voting governance：
anti-witch attack
* Web3 recommendation system：
Once data is linked on the blockchain, different gaming journeys, or brand marketing, personalized recommendations will become more efficient and user-friendly, while avoiding ineffective ad spending for brands.
* Web3 acquaintance social networking：
In the Web2 ecosystem, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft's account systems are closed and social information cannot be migrated. DID can naturally solve these problems in Web3. 

The boundaries between the two are not so clear, and they are intertwined. 

Overall, although DID can solve most of the problems, the topic that all Web3.0 activities cannot go around currently is the difficulty in describing the user, so it is difficult to have a real killer product. 

The current urgent development direction is to fill in this anchor point.





# Defining the Soul Attributes of an Individual in Metaverse

![soul-defining](/assets/images/post/Defining-a-Person's-Soul/soul.png)

As shown in the figure, the main problem is how to define a person in the Metaverse and how to represent this person in the digital world, as well as how to ensure the ownership of this person's identity, just like the impact and traces we create in the physical world are indelible. 

We can break down the concept of a person, and the question is what makes a person different from any other?

In the physical world, the impact a person had on the material world represents this person, as Marx pointed out in the Outline of Feuerbach, **that a person is the sum of all social relationships** , which are the expressions of the impact on the material world. 

Representing social relationships with data, including wealth, interpersonal relationships, daily life, daily consumption, work experience, and all other factors that make up a person's distinction. 

Observing these expressions, except for wealth, **they all have a fundamental characteristic of non-transferability**. Soulbound Tokens (SBT) may be a way to solve these problems.

## What is Soulbound Token?
Soulbound tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that is closely associated with a user's identity and is non-transferable. The concept originated in January of this year, when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published an article titled "Soulbound", referencing the concept of soulbinding from the online game World of Warcraft.

This proposes a formula: **SOUL = DID + SBT + Other On-Chain Assets**.
This represents a person's description of the fully-on-chain world.

## Analysis of Existing SBT Projects in the Blockchain Industry

### Binance ——Binance Account Bound
Binance recently launched the Binance Account Bound (BAB) token, a soul-bound token, which serves as an identity proof for KYC-verified users on Binance. 

Users can mint BAB tokens on the BNB chain and participate in the building of multiple projects to receive rewards. 

The benefits of having BAB tokens include airdrops and VIP privileges, as well as access to new functionalities introduced in the BNB ecosystem. 

### Goldfinch — Unsecured Lending
Goldfinch enables real-world investments in DeFi through uncollateralized loans. 

Borrowers are not over-collateralized, but instead their credit is displayed based on a collective assessment from other participants. USDC yields are about 17%. 

The Goldfinch protocol has three roles: investors, borrowers, and auditors. Auditors vote to approve borrowers and are randomly picked to provide human-level checks to prevent fraud and earn rewards. In order to prevent Sybil attacks, all participants must pass a “Unique Entity Check”. 

These are represented in non-fungible token (NFT) form as KYC, Know-Your-Business (KYB), and/or US accredited chain-based validations in the form of SBTs. Currently, there are 5 types of UIDs. 

Type 0 is reserved for non-US individuals, who can vote and provide funds, while type 2 non-US-accredited individuals can vote but not provide funds.

In order to receive a Unique Identity (UID), users submit an Ethereum transaction that generates a UID, which is sent to their address. 

The coolest thing about Goldfinch SBTs is that they can be freely used by any other protocol.
### Masa——Creating an Overall Financial Record
Masa Soulbound Identity is aiming to promote the mainstream adoption of chain-based credit for the next billion users. 

It allows people to connect their traditional accounts and crypto-currency accounts -- creating a decentralized credit report as a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that is soul-bound. Masa connects your Metamask, crypto-currency exchanges such as Binance, or crypto-addresses to create an “overall financial profile”. 

Compared to Goldfinch, Masa will provide non-collateralized loans for high-level executives of off-chain companies.

SBT is still in its early stages, but some use-cases have already been put into practice. 

We are excited to see more protocols emerge soon, to build the foundation for a decentralized Web3 society, where Metaverse identity is closely followed.



## Noteworthy SBT projects


### Yes3
Yes3 is a Q&A based endorsement DApp . The endorsee-centric model lets users ask for endorsements from people they regard as qualified.

For example(Official Example):
> Get some sense of the kind of endorsements enabled by Yes3 through several examples:
Ask “Am I a good team mate in Eth Shanghai hackathon? “ to your teammates who won a hackathon prize before.
Ask “Do you recommend me to work at Protocol Labs?” to someone working at Protocol Labs.
Ask “Are you pleasant discussing philosophy with me? “ to a friend you just had dinner with.

As previously mentioned, people are the sum of social relationships, and through this form of mutual endorsement, it is entirely possible to portray the soul on the chain and solve the current bottleneck of web3.0.

Possible development direction: Collaborating with centralized entities, users can submit questions or requests for centralized entities to prove, to which the centralized entities will reply with authenticated and signed SBTs. This way, large scale off-chain assets will be mapped onto the chain and serve as a bridge between the physical world and the blockchain world.









# Conclusion

At present, no satisfactory solution has been found for identity issues in web3.0. This article proposes a potential approach, which could be a real channel for a large number of users to enter web3.0 in the future.
